For creating database and adding domains
./base.rb --help


For deploying:
./base.rb setup_cap


It will first take the **domain** paramter and see if the domain is already added. If not it will add the domain
and the document root will be set to the paramter **doc_root**.
Then it will check for the database from the **db_name** paramter, if not added it will add the database.
Now it will check the database user from the **db_user** paramter, if not added it will add the user and assign it to the above database.If the 
user is already present it will reset its pass.
 
Now it will check **cap_dir** paramter and will see if the apps is present in that directory, else
it will check out/clone the apps from the repository url taking it from **co_url** parameter.

Now it will capify this apps.

Now we will need to run the below commands from the cap_dir directory.
1)cap deploy:setup
2)cap deploy

The cap deploy will add the database.yml and .htaccess file too.
